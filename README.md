# flappy-bird
A simple implementation of the beloved/hated Flappy Bird game, using the SFML library to handle I/O. The aim of this repository is to maintain and sharpen my C++ coding skills.

The program uses the standard C++ libraries, including the STL. In addition, you also need to install the SFML library. Steps are at: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

## Running

1. To generate the makefile, on a (linux) terminal, type: 'cmake CMakeLists.txt'.

2. To generate the executable, type: 'make'

3. To run the program, type: './flappy-bird'
