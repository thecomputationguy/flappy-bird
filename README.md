# flappy-bird

[WIP]

A simple implementation of the beloved/hated Flappy Bird game, using the SFML library to handle I/O. The aim of this repository is to maintain and sharpen my C++ coding skills.

The program uses the standard C++ libraries, including the STL. In addition, you also need to install the SFML library. Steps are at: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

This repository is largely inspired by the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNvRFEDQpOA&list=PLRtjMdoYXLf7DB3--POF9lYzaZu0poT5V&index=1&ab_channel=SonarSystems. Do consider visiting the channel!

## Running

1. To generate the makefile, on a (linux) terminal, type: 'cmake CMakeLists.txt'

2. To generate the executable, type: 'make'

3. To run the program, type: './flappy-bird'
